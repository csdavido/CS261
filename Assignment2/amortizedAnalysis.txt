1.
	The total cost of performing 32 consecutive pushes is 56. The complexity is O(1).

2.  The total cost of performing 32 consecutive pushes where the array 		grows by 2 spaces is 260. The complexity is O(n).

3. 	If the stack was pushed until it was full, and then popped, causing 	it to shrik, then the performace would be O(n^2).

	One would need to change the shrinking policy from N/2 to N/4 or N/6 to offset the poor performance.
